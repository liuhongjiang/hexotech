Recently, in our project we need enable tokenless auth for keystone, which means client or service can use client certificate to auth with out the token generated by keystone.

Following steps are the experiment I made on my development environment, and the os is centos7, my user account is andrew, you should change it to your account accordingly.

## Setup my own CA

Fristly, we need setup a CA to sign our client certificate.

Install openssl:

```
sudo yum install openssl
```

After openssl is installed, find the openssl conf file, and change the data directory of the CA.

```
[root@localhost ~]# locate openssl.cnf
/etc/pki/tls/openssl.cnf
/usr/share/man/man5/openssl.cnf.5ssl.gz
```

Change the dir configuration in the openssl.cnf file:

```
####################################################################
[ ca ]
default_ca      = CA_default            # The default ca section

####################################################################
[ CA_default ]

#dir            = /etc/pki/CA           # Where everything is kept
dir             = /home/irteam/CA       # Where everything is kept
```

<!--more-->

Then you should create related diretorys in `/home/irteam/CA` to store related files, such as CSR(Certificate Signing Request) file, private key file, or certificates.

```
[irteam@localhost CA]$ pwd
/home/irteam/CA
[irteam@localhost CA]$ mkdir certs newcerts private crl
[irteam@localhost CA]$ touch index.txt
[irteam@localhost CA]$ echo 01 > serial
```

This directory structure is very similar with the default data directory of CA:

```
[irteam@localhost CA]$ pwd
/etc/pki/CA
[irteam@localhost CA]$ ls
certs  crl  newcerts  private
```

`certs` is for signed certificates, `newcerts` is for new generated certificates, `private` is for private key files, `crl` is for revocation certificates.

Before generating any certificates, we need generated an random seed.

```
openssl rand -out private/.rand 1000
```


### generate root certificate

* generate private key for root certificate

Openssl used PEM(Privacy Enbanced Mail) to store private key. Here is the command to generate the private key.

```
openssl genrsa -aes256 -out private/cakey.pem 1024
```

when executed this command, it will ask you to input a password for your key, you need to remember that, because openssl will ask you to input that password when it using this key file.

* generate csr

The CSR(Certificate Signing Request) is the file you send to CA to generate your Certificate, here is how to generate it:

```
openssl req -new -key private/cakey.pem -out private/ca.csr -subj \
  "/C=CN/ST=myprovince/L=mycity/O=myorganization/OU=mygroup/CN=myname"
```

* generate root certificate

here is the command, and the root ceritficate is stored at `certs/ca.cer`:

```
openssl x509 -req -days 365 -sha1 -extensions v3_ca -signkey \
  private/cakey.pem -in private/ca.csr -out certs/ca.cer
```

here file extension suffix is `cer`, and for some certificate file, the extension suffix is `crt`, actually, file content for this two kind file are representing certificate data.
the extension only related how to open it on the windows. you can check it here: [How to convert CER to CRT certificates?](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/642284/apache-with-ssl-how-to-convert-cer-to-crt-certificates)

### generate server certificate

* generate key file

```
openssl genrsa -aes256 -out private/server-key.pem 1024
```

like the root certificate key file, you also need to remember the password for this key file.

* generate csr

Edit an conf file, and use it for openssl to generate server csr,
because we need to add `subjectAltName`, which defines the certificat can be used for multi domains.

```
[irteam@localhost CA]$ cat myserver.conf
[req]
default_bits       = 2048
distinguished_name = req_distinguished_name
req_extensions     = v3_req
x509_extensions = v3_req

[req_distinguished_name]
countryName                 = CN
countryName_default         = GB
stateOrProvinceName         = Sichuan
stateOrProvinceName_default = West Midlands
localityName                = Chengdu
localityName_default        = Birmingham
organizationName            = Flying Spaghetti Monster
organizationName_default    = Example
commonName                  = Andrew
commonName_max              = 64
[v3_req]
subjectAltName = @alt_names
keyUsage = keyEncipherment, dataEncipherment
extendedKeyUsage = serverAuth
[alt_names]
DNS.1   = openstack.andrew.com
DNS.2   = dev-openstack.andrew.com
DNS.3   = test-openstack.andrew.com
DNS.4   = local-openstack.andrew.com
```

then use this command to generate server csr (Certificate Signing Request) file:

```
openssl req -new -key private/server-key.pem -out private/server.csr -config myserver.conf
```

using the following command to verify the csr file.
```
openssl req -noout -text -in private/server.csr
```

* generate server Certificate


```
openssl x509 -req -days 365 -sha1 -extfile myserver.conf -extensions v3_req -CA certs/ca.cer -CAkey private/cakey.pem -CAserial ca.srl -CAcreateserial -in private/server.csr -out certs/server.cer
```

please pay attention to this two pramaters `-extfile myserver.conf -extensions v3_req`, it will use the `v3_req` section of myserver.conf as cert extentsion, andd add the `subjectAltName` to the certificate.

using the following command to check the certificate

```
openssl req -noout -text -in server.cer
```

### generate client certificate

* generate client private key
```
openssl genrsa -aes256 -out private/client-key.pem 1024
```

* generate client csr file

```
openssl req -new -key private/client-key.pem -out private/client.csr -subj \
  "/C=CN/ST=myprovince/L=mycity/O=myorganization/OU=mygroup/CN=andrew"
```

* sign client certificate

```
openssl x509 -req -days 365 -sha1 -extensions v3_req -CA certs/ca.cer -CAkey private/cakey.pem \
  -CAserial ca.srl -in private/client.csr -out certs/client.cer
```

## install ceritificates

After we genenerate all kind of certificates, we need install the CA certificate to our system, because it's not a trust certificate.

If we want to use the ceritficate for a server, then we need install the CA certificate on our client system.

If we want to use the client certificate for authenticate, for example in apache httpd, we need to config the CA certificate in the httpd configuration file.

This article shows how to install certificate on various system: [Adding trusted root certificates to the server](http://kb.kerio.com/product/kerio-connect/server-configuration/ssl-certificates/adding-trusted-root-certificates-to-the-server-1605.html)


## for python requests to add CA

Install the CA certificates on server, it works for the system tools, such as curl, but for the python requests libraray, it needs some extra work.

here in [the ca-certificates document of requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/user/advanced/#ca-certificates), it shows request used the [certifi](https://certifi.io) to manage CA certificates.

In the [pythone package of certifi](https://github.com/certifi/python-certifi), you can find the following documents:

using pip install certifi

```
$ pip install certifi
```

find the path of the cacert.pem file
```
>>> import certifi
>>> certifi.where()
'/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/certifi/cacert.pem'
```
then add your own ca file in to that cacert.pem

```
cat /home/irteam/CA/certs/ca.cer >> cacert.pem
```

then the requests can request the website, which using the certificate signed by your ca.


## remove passowrd of the key file
The key file is encrypted by the password which you input when you generate it.

If you used this key file for apache, when apache starts, it will ask you to input the password,
if you unencrypt the key with openssl, then apache will skip this part.

You’ll need the passphrase for the decryption process:
```
 # openssl rsa -in www.key -out new.key
```

Now copy the new.key to the www.key file and you’re done. Next time you restart the web server, it should not prompt you for the passphrase.
